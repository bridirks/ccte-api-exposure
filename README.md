# Exposure Microservice (ccte-api-exposure)

## Overview
The Exposure Microservice is a RESTful API designed to manage and provide Exposure data. It interacts with a PostgreSQL database and offers various endpoints for Exposure-related operations.

## Available Data
Data underlying the Exposure API comes from the Chemicals and Products Database (CPDat) [Learn more: The Chemical and Products Database, a resource for exposure-relevant data on chemicals in consumer products](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018125) and predictions from EPA’s Quantitative Structure Use Relationship (QSUR) models [Learn more: High-throughput screening of chemicals as functional substitutes using structure-based classification models](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/gc/c6gc02744j).

For exposure-related questions, contact the Chemical Exposure Knowledgebase team (chemexpo.support@epa.gov).

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for the development of the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Part of the Spring Data family, used to simplify data access and persistence.
- **Spring Data REST**: Used to expose Spring Data repositories as RESTful web services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used for storing Exposure data.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and build lifecycle.
- **Lombok**: Java library used to reduce boilerplate code.
- **MapStruct**: Code generator used to simplify the implementation of mappings between Java bean types.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Used for API documentation and testing.
- **Testcontainers**: Java library used for integration testing with Docker containers.

## Configuration
The application configuration is managed through properties files. The main configuration file is `application.properties`, and environment-specific configurations can be added as needed.

## Build and Deployment
The project uses Maven for build and deployment processes. Continuous integration and deployment can be set up using tools like GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started
To build and run the project locally, use the following Maven commands:

```sh
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
